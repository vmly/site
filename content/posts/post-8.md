Open source software development and online education are perhaps one of the most amazing aspects about software technology. All you need is an internet connection to learn something new. It is not essential to spend a lot of money to learn something new. There is plenty of wonderful information to study - indeed I'm often asked *where to learn X from* and *How I learn X*. Whether you are a programming newbie or an experienced engineer, I recommend you check out the sequence of guided learning patterns and resources presented if you want to pick up a new software today.

## Prerequisites

General prerequisites to learning any software are

* a programming language
* git for software version control
* docker for running software on isolated containers

## Getting Started

Lets call the software we want to **learn**

1. First Search

Its often a good idea to start with a couple of articles from web, just to understand the technology. No code, just read about the intended use of the software and use cases of how are people using this software.

1. Install

First, navigate to installation section and install the software prefarably with docker. It is much easier to setup with docker as you dont have to worry about dependencies, version incompatibility or polluting your global environment.

1. Try it out

Next, you go the quickstart / tutorial section in the site and read and implement the commands in the tutorial section presented to you.

1. Tutorials on Sites

Look for tutorials on sites like Medium, Dzone. You will get a overview of basic concepts, syntax and usage.
